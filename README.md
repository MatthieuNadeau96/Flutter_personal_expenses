## What I learned

### Flutter Fundamentals

- How to compose UI from build-in and custom Widgets
- That custom Widgets are also composed from build-in and other custom Widgets
- How to style and configure via arguments
- How to use the docs & IDE support

### Styling & Configuring Widgets

- That styling & layout options are very different: EdgeInsets.all(), BoxDecoration(), enums, ... => Docs and IDE support help
- Often, there's more than one Widget or option to get the job done

### Theming

- How to define a global theme for colors and text to then tap into it from anywhere in the app via Theme.of(context)
- Build-in Widgets use Theme settings automatically

### Business Logic

- Lift state up and use stateful widgets only when needed
- Pass functions and references and data around
- How to adjust the UI to my logic
